      "The Affenpinscher should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior). Some dogs are prone to getting overweight, so watch your dog’s calorie consumption and weight level. Treats can be an important aid in training, but giving too many can cause obesity. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not. Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog’s weight or diet. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2\n",
      "The Affenpinscher’s medium-length, wiry coat should be groomed twice a week, first with a brush and then with a metal comb. Any mats should be pulled apart with the fingers. The hair on the head is usually brushed forward over the face, and then an inverted V-shape is cut to expose the eyes. Similarly, the hair on the bridge of the nose is trimmed into a fan shape to keep the eyes clear. The Affen’s coat does not grow quickly, so a trimming a pet Affen every few months should suffice. The breed’s national parent club, the Affenpinscher Club of America, provides a detailed grooming guide. Affens should also have their nails trimmed and their teeth brushed regularly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3\n",
      "One of the attractions of the toy breeds is that their small size makes them ideal apartment dogs. While Affenpinschers can be perfectly happy living in close quarters, the breed is classified as “moderately active,” and as such, they do need exercise. Indoor play, both with his owner and just between himself and a toy, can be enough to make up a large chunk of an Affen’s exercise regimen. Even so, a brisk walk once or twice a day is required. In addition to providing exercise, these walks give the Affen a chance to socialize both with people and other dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4\n",
      "Affenpinschers are courageous, bold, and often feisty. Basic obedience training is recommended. The breed has an undeserved reputation as being difficult to train because Affenpinschers are independent minded and can be stubborn. The key is that they are very intelligent and generally eager to please the humans they have bonded with. Keep in mind that they are easily bored and tend to lose interest during long training sessions. Shorter, more frequent sessions with a trainer who has experience working with toy breeds are usually quite successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5\n",
      "Affenpinschers are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders will screen their stock for health conditions such as luxating patella, heart anomalies, vision problems, and hip dysplasia. Like other shorter-faced breeds, Affens can experience breathing problems during hot weather if they are permitted to overheat and then have difficulty panting in order to lower their body temperature, as dogs don’t sweat to keep cool.\n",

Any mats should be pulled apart with the fingers. The hair on the head is usually brushed forward over the face, and then an inverted V-shape is cut to expose the eyes. Similarly, the hair on the bridge of the nose is trimmed into a fan shape to keep the eyes clear. The Affen’s coat does not grow quickly, so a trimming a pet Affen every few months should suffice. The breed’s national parent club, the Affenpinscher Club of America, provides a detailed\\xa0grooming guide. Affens should also have their\\xa0nails trimmed\\xa0and their\\xa0teeth brushed\\xa0regularly.', 'One of the attractions of the toy breeds is that their\\xa0small size\\xa0makes them ideal apartment dogs. While Affenpinschers can be perfectly happy living in close quarters, the breed is classified as “moderately active,” and as such, they do need\\xa0exercise. Indoor play, both with his owner and just between himself and a toy, can be enough to make up a large chunk of an Affen’s exercise regimen. Even so, a\\xa0brisk walk\\xa0once or twice a day is required. In addition to providing exercise, these walks give the Affen a chance to socialize both with people and other dogs.', 'Affenpinschers are courageous, bold, and often feisty. Basic\\xa0obedience\\xa0training is recommended. The breed has an undeserved reputation as being difficult to train because Affenpinschers are independent minded and can be stubborn. The key is that they are very intelligent and generally eager to please the humans they have bonded with. Keep in mind that they are easily bored and tend to lose interest during long training sessions. Shorter, more frequent sessions with a trainer who has experience working with\\xa0toy breeds\\xa0are usually quite successful.', 'Affenpinschers are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders will screen their stock for health conditions such as luxating patella, heart anomalies, vision problems, and\\xa0hip dysplasia. Like other shorter-faced breeds, Affens can experience breathing problems during\\xa0hot weather\\xa0if they are permitted to overheat and then have difficulty panting in order to lower their body temperature, as dogs don’t sweat to keep cool.'], ['The\\xa0Afghan Hound should do well on a high-quality\\xa0dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior). As sight hounds, Afghan Hounds have naturally svelte physiques, and their protruding hipbones are a unique breed characteristic, not a sign of being underweight. That said, Afghan Hounds are athletic, active dogs, so be mindful that your dog is getting enough good nutrition to meet his needs.\\xa0Learn about which\\xa0human foods\\xa0are safe for dogs, and which are not. Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog’s weight or diet.\\xa0Clean, fresh water should be available at all times.', 'Afghan puppies have short, fuzzy coats (including adorable facial hair called “monkey whiskers”) that require little maintenance. They don’t stay that way for long, however. As is to be expected, the long, silky coat of an adolescent or adult Afghan requires regular\\xa0grooming. Several hours per week of brushing are needed to keep the hair free of tangles and mats, as well as to remove any debris. Keeping the hair clean and mat-free is the key to keeping the Afghan’s glorious coat looking its best.\\xa0Regular bathing, with shampoo and conditioner, is also required. Like all breeds, Afghans should have their\\xa0nails trimmed\\xa0and their\\xa0teeth brushed\\xa0regularly.', 'Because Afghans are sighthounds, bred to hunt and chase prey by sight, they will have a strong instinct to run off in pursuit of perceived prey; walking off leash is not advisable. Short walks do not provide enough exercise for this athletic breed, and some owners take their leashed Afghans on long runs once they reach maturity. Ideally, an Afghan should have the opportunity to run full out several times a week in a large, enclosed area. Afghans are tall, lean, and strong, which makes them excellent jumpers, so their exercise area must have a high, secure fence.', 'Afghans are independent, dignified, and aloof in general, but they are affectionate and extremely loyal to humans they have bonded with. This loyalty can make it difficult for an adult Afghan to adjust to a new home. On the other hand, it can make them fairly easy to housetrain, because they want to please their owners. Unless\\xa0obedience\\xa0or\\xa0agility\\xa0competition is a goal, teaching\\xa0basic commands\\xa0such as come, sit, and stay is generally sufficient. Afghan Hound owners are often quick to point out that no amount of training will overcome the breed’s hunting instinct to break off on a high-speed chase.', 'Sighthounds such as Afghans have naturally low stores of body fat, so they tend to be sensitive to anesthesia; breed experts recommend seeking out a sighthound-savvy veterinarian for surgical procedures. Like other deep-chested types of dogs, Afghan Hounds can experience\\xa0bloat, a sudden and life-threatening swelling of the abdomen, and owners should educate themselves about its symptoms and what to do should bloat occur.'], ['The\\xa0Airedale Terrier should do well on a high-quality\\xa0dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval.

Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog’s weight or diet.\\xa0Clean, fresh water should be available at all times.', 'The Airedale has a short, wiry coat that needs relatively little maintenance. Weekly brushing keeps the coat looking good and has the additional advantage of removing dead hair that would otherwise be shed around the house. (Some people with dog allergies have found that they can share a living space with a well-brushed Airedale without suffering any symptoms.) If the weekly session turns up any mats, they should be broken up with the fingers and then teased apart with a comb. Full grooming — where the dog is bathed, brushed, and stripped or clipped — should be done three or four times a year, either by the owner or a professional groomer.', 'Terriers are generally known for their high energy levels. Given that the Airedale is the largest of all terriers, that energy must be channeled into safe outlets. Fortunately, Airedales love to play with other family members. A daily play session of moderate length, in addition to walks (or backyard time) several times a day, should be enough to satisfy the Airedale’s exercise requirements. Airedales play well with children, but interactions with toddlers and smaller children should be closely supervised. Airedales are rangy but strong; that strength, combined with a boisterous personality, can lead to mishaps.', 'Because of the Airedale’s size (he is a medium-sized dog, but the largest of the terrier breeds), strength, and rambunctiousness,\\xa0obedience training is highly recommended. At a minimum, an Airedale should learn basic obedience commands such as come, sit, and stay. The breed’s intelligence and the fact that they bond closely with family members can make training easy. Owners and trainers should keep in mind that an\\xa0intelligent dog is an easily bored dog, so varied training sessions will be more successful than repetitive ones. Also, an easily bored dog who is often left alone for long periods of time will tend to develop undesirable behaviors. It often helps to provide the dog with challenging toys that will keep him happily occupied.', 'Airedales are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders will test for health concerns such as\\xa0hip dysplasia, a malformation of the hip joint.\\xa0 An Airedale’s ears should be checked regularly to remove foreign matter and avoid a buildup of wax, and his\\xa0teeth should be brushed regularly.'], ['The\\xa0Akita should do well on a high-quality\\xa0dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval.

Although Akitas shed only minimally most of the time, expect their dense undercoat to “blow” twice a year, where it will shed so profusely that it comes out in clumps all over your house. During this time it helps to brush the dog more frequently to get rid of the dead coat. The nails should also be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause pain and problems for the dog. Remember also to brush the dog’s teeth often to ensure dental health.', 'The Akita is generally not a highly active breed but does require moderate exercise. A jog or brisk walk around the block at least once a day can meet the needs of most individuals of the breed. Akitas also enjoy playing energetically. Although they are large dogs — males often weigh more than 100 pounds — with sufficient daily exercise Akitas can do well in a relatively small home. They are hardy dogs bred to withstand the harsh outdoor conditions of northern Japan, but they were bred as housedogs and guardians as well as hunters, and adapt very well to life in the home.', 'Akitas are very intelligent and loyal but also have an independent, headstrong nature. As large and very powerful dogs, it is vital that they are trained consistently,\\xa0\\xa0beginning in puppyhood. They are instinctive guardians, so it’s especially important that Akitas have early and extensive socialization when young. They must learn to accept a wide variety of strangers and not perceive them as a threat. Because of their independence and strong prey drive, they should never be off lead in an unsecured area. Akitas tend to be aggressive toward other dogs, particularly of the same sex, and extreme caution should be used in canine interactions.'], ['The\\xa0Alaskan Malamute should do well on a high-quality\\xa0dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval.

Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog’s weight or diet.\\xa0Clean, fresh water should be available at all times.', 'The thick, waterproof double coat of the Alaskan Malamute is beautifully adapted to harsh Arctic life, but it requires constant upkeep. A Malamute should be brushed every day with a pin brush and metal comb, all the while checking for mats, which can harbor fungus, and hot spots, which can become infected. Twice a year, during shedding season, an undercoat rake should be added to the regimen. Show Malamutes are often bathed weekly, but a pet Malamute can go six to eight weeks between baths.  Conditioner can be used, in moderation, if the coat feels dry. As with all breeds, the Malamute’s nails should be trimmed regularly.', 'While the Malamute was not bred for racing, he was bred to work. A strong, athletic dog with tremendous endurance, designed to carry heavy loads, a Mal requires daily exercise. Romping in a well-fenced yard or other enclosed space will suffice, but Malamutes also enjoy hiking, running, and swimming with their owners. And should the owner have sufficient time and interest, Malamutes often take part in agility and obedience trials, weight-pulling competitions, backpacking (yes, you can buy a backpack for your dog), recreational or competitive sledding, and skijoring (pulling a person who is on skis).', 'Socialization and\\xa0obedience training are necessary in order to prevent a Malamute from becoming pushy with children and other pets, or dominant over adults he or she doesn’t respect. Malamutes are highly intelligent but also independent and willful, often to the point of stubbornness. While fairness and patience can yield a devoted, trustworthy companion, there are certain behaviors that may be impossible to train out of a Mal, such as\\xa0digging, so any yard fencing must continue into the ground. And Malamutes are not especially suited to\\xa0be guard dogs because they tend to be friendly with everyone they meet.', 'A responsible breeder will screen breeding stock for health conditions such as\\xa0hip dysplasia\\xa0(a malformation of the hip joint that is the most common skeletal condition in dogs), elbow dysplasia, thrombopathia, chondrodysplasia (“dwarfism”), hypothyroidism, inherited polyneuropathy, von Willebrand’s disease, and day blindness. As with all breeds, an Alaskan Malamute’s ears should be checked regularly to remove foreign matter and avoid a buildup of wax, and his teeth should be brushed regularly.'], ['The\\xa0American English Foxhound should do well on a high-quality\\xa0dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior). Remember that a working dog requires a very different food than one who lives a more sedentary life.

His short, hard, protective coat requires a minimum of care. Using a shedding tool or a grooming mitt with rubber nubs at least weekly will help to keep his shedding to a minimum. This also distributes skin oils down the hair shaft, giving his coat a natural shine. His nails should be trimmed once a month, and a bath every four to six weeks will keep the coat and skin clean and healthy, and reduce doggy odor. His ears should be checked weekly and gently cleaned of any excess wax or debris.', 'With his high energy level and innate desire to be part of a pack, whether human or canine, the American English is an ideal candidate as a companion for someone who is an active runner, biker, or hiker. He needs a lot of exercise to stay healthy and happy. The breed has a very strong prey drive, so should never be allowed off leash in an uncontrolled situation, as he will not be able to resist the instinct to follow an interesting scent he detects with his sensitive nose. He requires a fenced area where he can run freely. Chasing a ball in his backyard can be an excellent source of exercise.', 'Following through with proper early socialization of your American English Coonhound is paramount, or your puppy may become possessive over food or toys in your home. The key to a well-adjusted, mentally healthy dog is to have him experience positive interactions with many different kinds of people in a variety of places and situations. Like many hounds, English dogs have a split personality: tenacious, tireless, and stubborn on the trail, but at home these spirited hunters are sweetly amiable companions. Still, the breed’s limitless prey drive and energy, the patience it takes to train them for anything other than coon hunting, and their tendency to bark in a loud, ringing voice make them most appropriate for experienced dog owners.', 'Still bred primarily as a hard-working dog, which must have an efficient physical condition, the American English Coonhound is generally a healthy breed. Responsible breeders will screen their stock for health conditions such as hip and elbow dysplasia as well as eye disorders such as progressive retinal atrophy and cataracts. His ears should be checked regularly to remove excess wax and debris. Like other large and deep-chested breeds, he can experience\\xa0bloat, a sudden, life-threatening stomach condition.

Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog’s weight or diet.\\xa0Clean, fresh water should be available at all times.', 'The American Eskimo Dog’s fluffy, white double coat — a short, dense undercoat below the longer outer coat — is surprisingly easy to keep clean. However, Eskies shed almost constantly. A thorough brushing two or three times a week will remove dead hairs before they can be shed, as well as help to prevent matting. The oil on an Eskie’s fur prevents dirt from adhering, so a good brushing is usually enough to remove it. It is OK to bathe  an Eskie occasionally, but doing so more than once every few months can make his skin dry and irritated. As with all breeds, the Eskie’s nails should be trimmed regularly.', 'An active dog with lots of energy, the Eskie is also quick and curious, requiring lots of exercise and mental challenges. An Eskie who is left alone or who doesn’t get enough exercise can quickly become destructive. A securely fenced yard and an assortment of toys will help provide good exercise and stimulation to keep an Eskie out of trouble. He shouldn’t just be left out in the yard by himself all day, however. Despite his warm coat, the Eskie is an indoor dog, and he forms strong bonds with his people and is happiest interacting with them. Once they pass middle age, Eskies often become more sedate.', 'As with all breeds,\\xa0early socialization and\\xa0puppy training classes are recommended. Fortunately, the American Eskimo Dog is among the most trainable of all breeds. Back when traveling circuses, vaudeville troupes, and Wild West shows crisscrossed the map, Eskies were mainstays of trained-dog acts. They are highly intelligent and eager to please. They learn new commands quickly — sometimes just by watching other dogs. An Eskie craves companionship and interaction with his owners and will tend to develop problem behaviors if left alone too often for long periods of time.', 'A responsible breeder will test his or her breeding stock for health issues such as\\xa0hip dysplasia and progressive retinal atrophy.

Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog’s weight or diet.\\xa0Clean, fresh water should be available at all times.', 'The American Foxhound’s handsome coat is short and lies close to the body. The coat’s hard texture protects the dog from the underbrush he courses through while on the hunt—and the coat also happens to be extremely easy to take care of. A short, once-a-week session with a bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt or tool, or a hound glove is usually all that is needed. The Foxhound should not need to be bathed unless he gets into something particularly messy while outdoors. As with all breeds, the American Foxhound‘s nails should be trimmed regularly.', 'Foxhounds were bred specifically to spend long hours chasing after prey. That’s why an American Foxhound needs at least a solid hour or two of exercise every day—if he doesn’t get it, he may become bored and destructive. If they get all the activity they need, they can fit in pretty much anywhere. While they are happiest living indoors with their human family, American Foxhounds make great companions on long walks or hikes. Because they were bred to hunt and chase animals and to follow a scent, they should only be allowed loose in areas that are securely fenced, and any walks must be taken on a leash. The breed also exercises mind and body by participating in canine sports such as tracking, rally, coursing ability tests, and other activities that can be enjoyed together by dog and owner.', 'American Foxhounds are easygoing and amiable. They also can be stubborn and independent, however, which can make training an exercise in patience. Obedience classes are recommended, and as scenthounds, it may never be safe to have them off-leash, because their noses can lead them into trouble. Foxhounds raised in the home tend to be wonderfully mild-tempered, devoted, and easygoing companions, and they get along well with children. Even so, owners will need patience and persistence when training them, and hounds can develop unwanted behaviors if not given enough exercise.', 'The American Foxhound is typically a healthy breed, and a\\xa0responsible breeder will test breeding stock for health conditions such as\\xa0hip dysplasia\\xa0and thrombocytopathy, which is a blood disorder.\\xa0 Long-eared breeds can develop\\xa0ear infections, and a Foxhound’s ears should be checked regularly to remove foreign matter and avoid a buildup of wax.

As with all breeds, the American Hairless Terrier‘s nails should be trimmed regularly.', 'The American Hairless Terrier has only moderate exercise needs. They have to go outside several times a day, of course, but brief daily sessions in a fenced-in yard or on regular walks will generally be all they require. They enjoy activity but are also quite happy to curl up on the couch next to their owner. The breed is friendly and happy to play with people or other dogs.

Maintain proper weight, but be careful not to overfeed. Groomers and veterinarians often see overweight Cockers.', 'Cocker Spaniels require regular, thorough grooming. Sessions missed are not easily made up and may result in tangles or mats in the Cocker’s coat. A metal, professional-quality dog comb with fine and medium spacing for the teeth is a necessity. You can follow combing with a gentle slicker brush, but the comb is key. Loose hair should be carefully removed with the comb, making sure you are clear and can see through to the skin everywhere. If you encounter snarls, do not pull through; rather, pick snarls apart, starting at the tips of the coat and then comb through. Be cautious when combing ears; the skin at the edges is thin and can be pierced by too-vigorous combing. The Cocker requires thorough bathing with quality dog shampoo. Thorough rinsing and re-rinsing are crucial, as soap residue can cause skin irritation. Dry carefully with a blow-dryer on not too hot a setting. Learn the procedure for cleaning and drying the ear canals. During bathing, check the Cocker’s skin for any inflamed spots and get treatment. It is key to learn grooming procedures yourself and/or enlist the services of a professional groomer who likes and is experienced in grooming the breed.', 'The Cocker Spaniel is a sporting breed and should maintain good muscle tone, although the breed is not one that needs a lot of exercise for the purpose of discharging an abundance of energy. Cockers often enjoy getting their exercise by means of retrieving a ball or other toy, or accompanying their people on a walk. They very much enjoy spending time with their people, so walking is a good exercise option. If the Cocker has a canine companion, they can play to exercise each other. The Cocker Spaniel wants to please people and enjoys play, so these are tools you can use to encourage exercise.', 'Regarding training the Cocker Spaniel, the good news is that in general this is a people-pleasing breed. They want to be “good” in order to please their people, and they are generally sensitive and responsive to correction and a disapproving tone in their owner’s voice. Harsh means of correction are not usually warranted, nor are they productive in the Cocker. The breed enjoys the challenge of performance activities, and it is a good idea to try out the available activities and events to see what interests your individual Cocker and follow through with training. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Cockers are rather easily motivated with food rewards and with play and praise.', 'The Cocker Spaniel’s national parent club, the American Spaniel Club, has a health committee that looks at breed health issues and makes recommendations to breeders for required health testing.The Cocker Spaniel has good longevity. A conscientious breeder can furnish records of the sire’s and dam’s health testing, for example for hips, patellas, and eyes. Breeders often have years of data regarding testing done in these health areas. Learn from the veterinarian proper procedures to clean the Cocker’s ear canals on a regular basis, especially following a bath, in order to avoid infections. Thorough grooming of the Cocker coat will aid in preventing mats, which can precipitate skin problems underneath.'], ['Good nutrition is the very first thing the owner can do for their Collie to ensure healthy skin and coat and general well being. Collies do well on a good-quality dog food that is primarily meat-based, with fewer grains as ingredients. Many breed experts feel that Collies should not be fed foods with corn or soy in the ingredients. Collies have a risk of bloat, so two feedings/multiple feedings per day as opposed to once a day is recommended, and some meat added to the food has been shown to reduce risk.', 'Smooth Collies, while they won’t mat, require regular grooming, as they have a double coat, and the undercoat needs brushing out during shedding periods. Rough Collies need attention to avoid matting, especially in certain areas such as behind the ears and elbows, and to remove loose undercoat. A weekly brushing down to the skin eliminates that problem and keeps the coat and skin healthy. If females are spayed, they do a big shed once a year; if intact, females shed about three months after their heat cycle, and males around their birthday, so those times require a little extra grooming.', 'While there are variations among individuals and families, Collies generally are quite active and require regular exercise. They need aerobic exercise and the chance to be able to run and play. Teaching them to fetch can provide good exercise, and having a fenced yard where they can run and going on daily walks help too. They should not be relegated to the backyard for long periods of time, as with boredom comes barking. Collies are people dogs and want to be with their owners first and foremost. Ideally a Collie will be ready to go when it’s time to go, and able to chill when it’s time to chill.', 'While Collies are very smart and easy to train, puppy classes are recommended for general socialization and training. But it shouldn’t end there. Collies love training and learning, and both make for a better companion and build a good relationship with the owner and family. Collies thrive on positive teaching methods. They excel in obedience, agility, and herding, and even barn hunt and lure coursing, and owners will discover something fun to do with their dog!', 'The Collie Health Foundation has invested lots of research dollars to identify and solve health issues, and their website offers great information on health issues in the breed. The minimum requirement is for puppies between 6-8 weeks old to have an eye check by a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist for Collie eye anomaly, an inherited eye disease. Some Collies may also have a sensitivity to certain drugs, known as the MDR1 mutation. More information can be found on this at http://vcpl.vetmed.wsu.edu. Collies typically live from 12 to 14 years and are as a rule healthy, but after doing their research prospective buyers should ask questions of breeders and have an understanding of what health guarantees can be provided.'], ['A high-quality dog food appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior) will have all the nutrients the breed needs.

Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog’s weight or diet.', 'Grooming the Coton puppy is a breeze. During that time you should groom him regularly and ensure that he learns to see grooming sessions as positive times of bonding with his person. Unless you are going to keep your Coton in a short “puppy clip,” your dog will require a great deal of brushing. You must be careful to get your comb and brush all the way to the skin (gently) during daily brushing, or the hair next to the skin will mat and if this is too extensive your dog may need to be shaved down. You should use a spray conditioner while brushing to avoid breakage. A couple of times a week, check the ears and remove any excess hair, wax, or debris to avoid ear infections.', 'The Coton is a fairly active dog who requires a moderate amount of exercise. Daily walks with his human at a slow speed will keep him in good weight and condition. Chasing a tennis ball around his backyard can keep his mind active as well as his body. A bored and unhappy Coton can become destructive. He does best when provided with enough exercise, lots of attention from his owner, and plenty of interesting toys to keep him occupied.', 'The Coton is an alert dog and naturally territorial. Cotons should be well socialized from an early age so that they will enjoy going with you wherever you go. Obedience training is a good idea, for socialization as well as reinforcing lessons and manners. A bored Coton will be unable to learn anything. Keep your training sessions lively and entertaining for best results. Cotons respond poorly to negative training practices but will excel in most dog-sport activities when trained with positive methods. They do well in agility and obedience and make excellent therapy dogs.', 'The Coton de Tulear has remained fairly free of genetic health issues. That is not to say that they do not exist, but that any incidences are of an extremely low percentage. In the Coton, known incidences are usually in the one- to five-percent range. Coton breeders are working diligently to keep the breed as problem free as possible by doing genetic screening of all breeding stock.

Females may look relatively bare when not in coat. During shedding season a rake-type grooming tool with metal prongs is good at removing the dead hair, then the coat can be scissored down. The majority of owners never brush a Curly-Coated Retriever, as then the coat frizzes. A wet-down and air-dry is easy to do and often will enhance the curls. The breed does not need to be bathed frequently.

Their home does not need to be a large one as long as they are with their owner and have adequate exercise. The breed is very easy to live with as long as they have been shown their “good manners” with basic training. They love to be outside, yet they are very happy to spend time indoors at home with their people. They are not a breed who is good at being left alone for long periods of time.', 'The owner of a Curly-Coated Retriever needs to be firm but kind in training of the dog. Too rough, and they will turn tail; too soft or unclear, and they will not pay attention. They are an intelligent breed and smart enough to need an owner who is smarter than they are. Two things are helpful to remember regarding training a Curly: First, avoid too much repetition, as the dog may become bored and lose interest. Also, it is important for an owner to try to make the learning situation as much fun as possible. The goal is to make it so that the Curly enjoys what is being taught. Some Curlies do very well in the obedience ring, but for some the repetition of some of the exercises can cause disinterest. Training for fieldwork takes a knowledgeable approach and should not be rough. When new to the breed and interested in starting field training, find a training group in your area with whom you can train, and observe their methods before deciding to join.', 'The majority of Curlies are a healthy breed. Breeders have been very diligent about screening hips, eyes, and the heart. There are some cancer concerns.

Between shedding seasons, you might be able to skip it for a few weeks, if your Drent doesn’t carry the brush up to you for the attention.', 'Drents are intelligent hunting dogs in need of stimulation and regular exercise, regardless of the weather. They are wonderful hiking partners, but also suitable for canicross, or any of the “joring” sports. The Drent also would be good for agility, or other “action” sport where mind and body are engaged. This breed is not suitable for sedentary lifestyles.', 'The Drent is known to be obedient, loyal and attentive, but on occasion, they can be stubborn and self-thinking. These intelligent dogs bore with monotonous and repetitious activities. Possibly the Drent’s greatest attribute is his strong and innate eagerness to please his boss. Due to the Drents slow emotional development and at times obstinate character, a benevolent handler is necessary with a good sense of humor. The playfulness and enthusiasm that can make the Drent easy to train are the very same qualities that can require training to take a long time to get to exam level obedience. While the standard states that the dog is “naturally obedient”, please don’t think this breed can go without training. The time and energy invested will prove to be well worth the effort.', 'In broad strokes, the Drent is a healthy breed. Certainly some individuals may suffer from any canine malady, but that isn’t representative across the breed as a common issue or health concern. From a genetic standpoint, the Drent has only a few hereditary diseases to know about and monitor in order to keep incidences low.\\nThe Drent’s eyes should be monitored for the following hereditary diseases: Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA), Distichiasis, Entropion and Ectropion, Persistent Pupillay Membranes (PPM), and Retinal Dysplasisa. Other diseases or abnormalities which have been found in the Drent are: hemophilia, hypothyroidism, cryptorchidism, hyperuricosuria, significant reactions to poisonous insect bites/stings and the absence of certain teeth.\\nLike many breeds, hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia should be monitored and all breeding stock screened for. Joint dysplasia is influenced by genetics and environment, so using care during the Drents’ rapid growth period is advisable.\\nAmongst breed authorities, Epilepsy is considered to be the greatest current health threat to the Drent. Still, incidence rates remain undocumented and unverified; the locus of the disease in the Drent has not been located.\\nThe most common, but usually non-problematic, is von Willebrand disease type-I (vWD-I). Despite a high incidence rate of carriers and affected dogs in the population, Drents do not present the disease in clinical terms, despite what modern science has to say about the issue. Paw Print Genetics has studied this phenomenon and their findings were validated by Cornell University. Von Willebrand disease type-I is detectable by the Paw Print Genetics DNA health panel. While the disease is of interest, it is considered to be of little threat for the Drent, yet the DPCNA is striving to lower the incidence rate in the North American population.'], ['You are going to want to feed your Drever a formula that will cater to his unique digestive needs throughout the various phases of his life.

Some experienced breeders have found terriers to do well on a moderate-protein diet (mid-20-percent protein), with a bit of an additive such as canned food.', 'Scottish Terriers require regularly scheduled grooming. They are a dual-coated breed, with a harsh, wiry outer layer and dense, soft undercoat. Ideally, they are hand stripped. This should be started when they are young puppies so they get used to the process. Once a month would be best once the coat is started, but they can be worked on weekly. If you are not doing it yourself, it may be hard to find a groomer who will do this for a pet. In that case it is acceptable to clipper the coat. With clipping you will eventually lose the correct harsh texture, as the undercoat will take over once the cutting process is begun. Clipped coats can be maintained on a six- to eight-week schedule. A weekly brushing and comb-out will keep the Scottie’s coat tangle free and the skin healthy. Periodic baths with the grooming is acceptable with a good-quality moisturizing shampoo.', 'Scottish Terriers need a good walk, but also good playtime. They have high energy and need to expend some of that in bursts. Throwing a ball or toy around that they can chase works great. Their nickname is the “diehard,” and all you have to do is play tug with a favorite toy to see they won’t stop or let go until you do. All of that activity will keep them in good shape and attitude. This makes them great dogs for a small home or apartment living.', 'Scottish Terriers do best with training sessions not lasting more than 15 minutes at a time. Be creative, and do not repeat the training the same way all the time. This breed is a thinker, and if they get bored, they will not respond. Remember, the farmers kept the dogs who could figure things out—not the ones who had to be told what to do. Don’t be surprised when they test you. There is an independent streak in them. That is best focused when you make it seem like it is their idea to do something. They respond greatly to vocal tones and know why you are displeased by your voice. Just be persistent, and reward good behavior.', 'The breed’s national parent club, the Scottish Terrier Club of America, provides excellent information regarding breed health issues on the club website.

In general, Shibas are not massively destructive if left alone once they reach maturity, but some can suffer separation anxiety and should be able to spend periods of time crated even when the owners are home and at night. Crating guarantees a home will remain intact.', 'The one thing every Shiba owner must know is that a Shiba can never, ever be considered reliable off lead unless in a confined area. No amount of obedience training will ever change that. Letting a Shiba off lead—or any dog, for that matter—is playing Russian roulette with its life. An open door, an unlocked gate, a moment of inattentiveness, and the Shiba may be gone forever. On the positive side, a Shiba is practically born housebroken.

This breed is well suited for search and rescue work and adapts to the training easily.', 'Bouviers are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders will screen their stock for health conditions such as Bouvier des Flandres myopathy, cataracts, deafness, ectopic ureters, epilepsy, glaucoma, hip dysplasia, hypothyroidism, laryngeal paralysis, megaesophagus, elbow dysplasia, portosystemic shunt, and subaortic stenosis. Like all large and deep-chested breeds, the\\xa0Bouvier can experience gastric dilatation and\\xa0bloat.\\xa0Owners should learn how identify this potentially life-threatening condition and learn what emergency steps to take to address it.')\n",

His\\xa0nails\\xa0should be trimmed at least once a month unless naturally worn down on a hard surface, and to prevent tartar buildup his teeth should\\xa0be\\xa0brushed\\xa0often—daily if possible.', 'Boxers are very playful, high-energy dogs. They need ample\\xa0exercise every day, on leash or in a securely fenced area. The Boxer must never be allowed to run loose. The breed’s heritage as a chaser of wild game means that they spend a good deal of time jumping and leaping about—as young dogs, they are constantly in need of reminders to teach them to stay “down.” Because the Boxer is a powerful, active, and playful dog, he may not be the best choice for a very frail adult, nor for a small child who could be overwhelmed by a well-meaning but bouncy puppy.', 'Early\\xa0socialization\\xa0and\\xa0puppy training classes\\xa0are vital in channeling the breed’s energy and exuberance in a positive way. Boxers are highly intelligent, but can become bored with repetition. They tend to have a mind of their own and are excellent problem solvers. Not always tolerant of other dogs of the same sex, most Boxers of opposite sexes enjoy each other’s company. Boxers excel in a wide range of canine sports, including\\xa0obedience,\\xa0agility, and herding, and they perform brilliantly as service, assistance, and\\xa0therapy\\xa0dogs, and in roles such as drug detection and search-and-rescue.', 'The Boxer does not have a high tolerance for either extreme heat or cold, and he should always be kept inside the house as a beloved member of the family.\\xa0Responsible breeders\\xa0screen their stock for health conditions such as\\xa0hip dysplasia, heart conditions such as aortic stenosis and cardiomyopathy, thyroid deficiency, degenerative myelopathy, and certain cancers.

They do best with active people, especially those seeking an athletic partner for activities like hiking, running, or biking. Regular exercise will help keep the Boykin healthy and happy.
