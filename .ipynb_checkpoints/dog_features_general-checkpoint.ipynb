Originating in Germany, the name Affenpinscher means “monkey-like terrier.” The breed was developed to rid the kitchens, granaries, and stables of rodents. In France the breed is described as the “Diablotin Moustachu,” or moustached little devil, reflecting both the appearance and attitude of this delightful breed. The total overall appearance of the Affenpinscher is more important than any individual characteristic. He is described as having a neat but shaggy appearance.</p>\n",

      "<div class=\"breed-standard__content-wrap\"><p>The head is in proportion to the body, carried confidently with monkey-like facial expression. Eyes- Round, dark, brilliant, and of medium size in proportion to the head but not bulging or protruding. Eye rims are black. Ears – Cropped to a point, set high and standing erect; or natural, standing erect, semi-erect or dropped. All of the above types of ears, if symmetrical, are acceptable as long as the monkey-like expression is maintained. Skull – Round and domed, but not coarse. Stop -Well-defined. Muzzle – Short and narrowing slightly to a blunt nose. The length of the muzzle is approximately the same as the distance between the eyes. Nose – Black, turned neither up nor down. Lips – Black, with prominent lower lip. Bite – Slightly undershot. A level bite is acceptable if the monkey-like expression is maintained. An overshot bite is to be severely penalized. A wry mouth is a serious fault. The teeth and tongue do not show when the mouth is closed. The lower jaw is broad enough for the lower teeth to be straight and even.</p>\n",

The back is short and level with a strong loin. The croup has just a perceptible curve. Tail may be docked or natural. A docked tail is generally between 1 and 2 inches long, set high and carried erect. The natural tail is set high and carried curved gently up over the back while moving.

      "<p>The Affenpinscher’s medium-length, wiry coat should be groomed twice a week, first with a brush and then with a metal comb. Any mats should be pulled apart with the fingers. The hair on the head is usually brushed forward over the face, and then an inverted V-shape is cut to expose the eyes. Similarly, the hair on the bridge of the nose is trimmed into a fan shape to keep the eyes clear. The Affen’s coat does not grow quickly, so a trimming a pet Affen every few months should suffice.

      "GENERAL APPEARANCE\n",
      "The Affenpinscher is a balanced, wiry-haired terrier-like toy dog whose intelligence and demeanor make him a good house pet. Originating in Germany, the name Affenpinscher means “monkey-like terrier.” The breed was developed to rid the kitchens, granaries, and stables of rodents. In France the breed is described as the “Diablotin Moustachu,” or moustached little devil, reflecting both the appearance and attitude of this delightful breed. The total overall appearance of the Affenpinscher is more important than any individual characteristic. He is described as having a neat but shaggy appearance.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "HEAD\n",
      "The head is in proportion to the body, carried confidently with monkey-like facial expression. Eyes- Round, dark, brilliant, and of medium size in proportion to the head but not bulging or protruding. Eye rims are black. Ears – Cropped to a point, set high and standing erect; or natural, standing erect, semi-erect or dropped. All of the above types of ears, if symmetrical, are acceptable as long as the monkey-like expression is maintained. Skull – Round and domed, but not coarse. Stop -Well-defined. Muzzle – Short and narrowing slightly to a blunt nose. The length of the muzzle is approximately the same as the distance between the eyes. Nose – Black, turned neither up nor down. Lips – Black, with prominent lower lip. Bite – Slightly undershot. A level bite is acceptable if the monkey-like expression is maintained. An overshot bite is to be severely penalized. A wry mouth is a serious fault. The teeth and tongue do not show when the mouth is closed. The lower jaw is broad enough for the lower teeth to be straight and even.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "BODY\n",
      "Short and straight. Topline straight and level. Body – The chest is moderately broad and deep; ribs are moderately sprung. Tuckup is slight. The back is short and level with a strong loin. The croup has just a perceptible curve. Tail may be docked or natural. A docked tail is generally between 1 and 2 inches long, set high and carried erect. The natural tail is set high and carried curved gently up over the back while moving. The type of tail is not a major consideration.\n",

      "FOREQUARTERS\n",

Front legs straight when viewed from any direction. Pasterns short and straight. Dewclaws generally removed. Feet small, round, and compact with black pads and nails.\n",

      "COAT\n",
      "Dense hair, rough, harsh, and about 1 inch in length on the shoulders and body. May be shorter on the rear and tail. Head, neck, chest, stomach and legs have longer, less harsh coat. The mature Affenpinscher has a mane or cape of strong hair which blends into the back coat at the withers area. The longer hair on the head, eyebrows and beard stands off and frames the face to emphasize the monkey-like expression. Hair on the ears is cut very short. A correct coat needs little grooming to blend the various lengths of hair to maintain a neat but shaggy appearance.\n",

While Affenpinschers can be perfectly happy living in close quarters, the breed is classified as “moderately active,” and as such, they do need exercise. Indoor play, both with his owner and just between himself and a toy, can be enough to make up a large chunk of an Affen’s exercise regimen. Even so, a brisk walk once or twice a day is required. In addition to providing exercise, these walks give the Affen a chance to socialize both with people and other dogs.\n",

      "GENERAL APPEARANCE\r\n",
      "The Affenpinscher is a balanced, wiry-haired terrier-like toy dog whose intelligence and demeanor make him a good house pet. Originating in Germany, the name Affenpinscher means “monkey-like terrier.” The breed was developed to rid the kitchens, granaries, and stables of rodents. In France the breed is described as the “Diablotin Moustachu,” or moustached little devil, reflecting both the appearance and attitude of this delightful breed. The total overall appearance of the Affenpinscher is more important than any individual characteristic. He is described as having a neat but shaggy appearance.\r\n",
      "HEAD\r\n",
      "The head is in proportion to the body, carried confidently with monkey-like facial expression. Eyes- Round, dark, brilliant, and of medium size in proportion to the head but not bulging or protruding. Eye rims are black. Ears – Cropped to a point, set high and standing erect; or natural, standing erect, semi-erect or dropped. All of the above types of ears, if symmetrical, are acceptable as long as the monkey-like expression is maintained. Skull – Round and domed, but not coarse. Stop -Well-defined. Muzzle – Short and narrowing slightly to a blunt nose. The length of the muzzle is approximately the same as the distance between the eyes. Nose – Black, turned neither up nor down. Lips – Black, with prominent lower lip. Bite – Slightly undershot. A level bite is acceptable if the monkey-like expression is maintained. An overshot bite is to be severely penalized. A wry mouth is a serious fault. The teeth and tongue do not show when the mouth is closed. The lower jaw is broad enough for the lower teeth to be straight and even.\r\n",
      "BODY\r\n",
      "Short and straight. Topline straight and level. Body – The chest is moderately broad and deep; ribs are moderately sprung. Tuckup is slight. The back is short and level with a strong loin. The croup has just a perceptible curve. Tail may be docked or natural. A docked tail is generally between 1 and 2 inches long, set high and carried erect. The natural tail is set high and carried curved gently up over the back while moving. The type of tail is not a major consideration.\r\n",
      "FOREQUARTERS\r\n",
      "Front angulation is moderate. Shoulders – with moderate layback. The length of the shoulder blade and the upper arm are about equal. Elbows – close to the body. Front legs straight when viewed from any direction. Pasterns short and straight. Dewclaws generally removed. Feet small, round, and compact with black pads and nails.\r\n",
      "HINDQUARTERS\r\n",
      "Rear angulation is moderate to match the front. Hindlegs straight when viewed from behind. From the side, hindlegs are set under the body to maintain a square appearance. The length of the upper thigh and the second thigh are about equal with moderate bend to the stifle. Hocks – Moderately angulated.\r\n",
      "COAT\r\n",
      "Dense hair, rough, harsh, and about 1 inch in length on the shoulders and body. May be shorter on the rear and tail. Head, neck, chest, stomach and legs have longer, less harsh coat. The mature Affenpinscher has a mane or cape of strong hair which blends into the back coat at the withers area. The longer hair on the head, eyebrows and beard stands off and frames the face to emphasize the monkey-like expression. Hair on the ears is cut very short. A correct coat needs little grooming to blend the various lengths of hair to maintain a neat but shaggy appearance.\r\n",

      " NUTRITION\r\n",
      "The Affenpinscher should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior). Some dogs are prone to getting overweight, so watch your dog’s calorie consumption and weight level. Treats can be an important aid in training, but giving too many can cause obesity. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not. Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog’s weight or diet. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times.\r\n",
      " GROOMING\r\n",
      "The Affenpinscher’s medium-length, wiry coat should be groomed twice a week, first with a brush and then with a metal comb. Any mats should be pulled apart with the fingers. The hair on the head is usually brushed forward over the face, and then an inverted V-shape is cut to expose the eyes. Similarly, the hair on the bridge of the nose is trimmed into a fan shape to keep the eyes clear. The Affen’s coat does not grow quickly, so a trimming a pet Affen every few months should suffice. The breed’s national parent club, the Affenpinscher Club of America, provides a detailed grooming guide. Affens should also have their nails trimmed and their teeth brushed regularly.\r\n",
